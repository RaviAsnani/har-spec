# HTTP Archive (HAR)

One of the goals of the HTTP Archive format is to be flexible enough so, it can be adopted across projects and various tools. This should allow effective processing and analyzing data coming from various sources. Notice that resulting HAR file can contain privacy & security sensitive data and user-agents should find some way to notify the user of this fact before they transfer the file to anyone else.
